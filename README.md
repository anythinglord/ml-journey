# Machine Learning Project

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of various **Machine Learning** algorithms to solve prediction, classification, and data analysis problems. The examples presented here are implemented in Python, using libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **pandas**.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `datasets/`: Sample datasets used in the models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with interactive examples and detailed analysis.
- `src/`: Implementations of the Machine Learning algorithms.
- `models/`: Saved trained models.
- `README.md`: Project description and usage guide.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
4. **Decision Trees**
5. **Artificial Neural Networks**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**
7. **Clustering with K-Means**
8. **Random Forest**

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need to have the following Python packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow (optional, for neural networks)

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/machine-learning-project.git
cd machine-learning-project
```

### 2. Run the notebooks

You can open the Jupyter notebooks to run interactive examples:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/example.ipynb
```

### 3. Train models

In the `src/` directory, you will find scripts to train models on different datasets. For example, to train a linear regression model:

```bash
python src/linear_regression.py --dataset datasets/data.csv
```
